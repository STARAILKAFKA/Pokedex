# Pokedex
This is my new 1st project, which is Pokedex

## Developer
There is only 1 developer which is me only

## Website error?
If you can't see the Pokedex, check whether the URL is correct.
Wrong URL: https://starailkafka.github.io/Pokedex
Correct URL: https://starailkafka.github.io/Pokedex/Pokedex
I don't know why my URL looks strange, anyway enjoy my <b>CLASSIC</b> Pokedex

### Updates
Temporarily noting yet :(

### Known Problems
1) The inside of the Pokedex background is the same as the outside
2) The Boarder color is not correct

Try to fix someday :(
